Also called metaprogramming, as a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at compile time. First, specify that value() method is also an attribute of Alphabet then, we use the attribute value to specify the Python property setter and the deleter. Notice that the same method value() is used with different definitions for defining the getter, setter, and deleter. Whenever we use x.value, it internally calls the appropriate getter, setter, and deleter."
